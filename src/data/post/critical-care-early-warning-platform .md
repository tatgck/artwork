## Target

This implementation establishes a multi-model integrated platform for real-time patient risk surveillance, enabling continuous assessment of critical conditions through unified computational frameworks.

## Background

**Clinical Pain Point Analysis** <br />
Critical care units manage high-acuity patients with unpredictable deterioration, requiring intensive monitoring that consumes 68% of nursing time (per JCAHO benchmarks). However, prevailing nurse-to-patient ratios of 1:1.5 fall below recommended standards of 1:3-1:5, creating significant safety gaps in risk response capabilities.

**Model Management Challenges** <br />
Existing model deployments face three core challenges:

a) Validation Fragility
Static models lacking continuous data ingestion fail persistent clinical validation (per FDA SaMD guidelines)

b) Dataset Fragmentation
Disparate variable requirements force redundant data provisioning, hindering hospital-wide data asset consolidation

c) Research Silos
Proliferation of single-study models (67% being pilot academic projects) creates operational complexity"*

### Key Innovations

1. **Proprietary Model Registry**
   - Unified lifecycle management for diverse models (debugging/configuration/testing)
   - **Intelligent patient-risk matching:** Automatically deploys highest-risk prediction models based on individual clinical profiles

2. **Multidimensional Model Visualization**
   - Integrated display of temporal/non-temporal models with parameter evolution tracking
   - **Context-aware fusion:** Synchronizes model outputs with live patient vitals and EHR data

3. **Customized Alert Governance**
   - **Granular RBAC + HIPAA-compliant anonymization**
   - **Adaptive thresholding:** Dynamically suppresses low-priority alerts to combat clinical fatigue
