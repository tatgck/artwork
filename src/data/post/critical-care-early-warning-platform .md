## Target

This implementation establishes a multi-model integrated platform for real-time patient risk surveillance, enabling continuous assessment of critical conditions through unified computational frameworks.

## Background

**Clinical Pain Point Analysis** <br />
Critical care units manage high-acuity patients with unpredictable deterioration, requiring intensive monitoring that consumes 68% of nursing time (per JCAHO benchmarks). However, prevailing nurse-to-patient ratios of 1:1.5 fall below recommended standards of 1:3-1:5, creating significant safety gaps in risk response capabilities.

**Model Management Challenges** <br />
Existing model deployments face three core challenges:

a) Validation Fragility
Static models lacking continuous data ingestion fail persistent clinical validation (per FDA SaMD guidelines)

b) Dataset Fragmentation
Disparate variable requirements force redundant data provisioning, hindering hospital-wide data asset consolidation

c) Research Silos
Proliferation of single-study models (67% being pilot academic projects) creates operational complexity"*

### Breakthroughs

1. **Innovative Model Repository Management:** Establishes a unified repository for diverse model types, enabling dedicated model management capabilities including **debugging, administration, configuration, and validation.** Crucially, the system **automatically selects and applies the highest-risk model** based on individual patient profiles for optimal clinical relevance.
2. **Multi-dimensional Model Visualization:** Effectively presents models across various dimensions. This includes, but is not limited to, **temporal (time-series) and non-temporal models,** visualization of **model parameter evolution history,** and **integrated displays combining model outputs with critical patient information** for comprehensive clinical insight.
3. **Granular Access Control & Alert Optimization:** Implements **role-based access controls (RBAC) for patient data visibility** combined with **configurable data permissions (e.g., anonymization protocols).** This enables **customizable, tiered alert management,** effectively **mitigating clinical alert fatigue** caused by an overload of low-priority notifications through tailored, risk-based alerting strategies.

### Implementation Strategy

![Framework](../../assets/images/blog/2-fream01.png "Simplified Framework")

1. **Foundation: Real-time & Historical Patient Data Hub:** Provides a **core platform for collecting and managing standardized, general patient datasets.** This platform **integrates real-time data from current inpatients with comprehensive historical patient records** to form a robust data foundation.
2. **Centralized Model Repository Framework:** Implements a **comprehensive model registry mechanism.** This supports **model registration, version control, threshold configuration, hyperparameter tuning,** and essential lifecycle management tasks within the unified repository.
3. **Robust Data Governance & Access Control:** Establishes **granular data permissions and strict data isolation protocols.** Data is **tagged and segmented** based on criteria like **department, ward, and disease type.** This segmentation is **tightly integrated with the RBAC system,** enabling highly **flexible and secure foundational configurations** tailored to organizational structure and needs.

### Future Outlook

1. **Data as Strategic Digital Assets:** High-quality, curated datasets evolve into **valuable organizational digital assets,** paving the way for **systematic digital asset management and potential value exchange mechanisms** within or between trusted entities.
2. **Model Reusability & Cost Efficiency:** High-performance models trained on these assets become **readily reusable resources.** This enables **cross-organizational deployment and adaptation,** significantly **reducing development costs and accelerating implementation** for similar clinical needs elsewhere.
3. **API-Driven Open Ecosystem & Collaboration:** The internal model training and management infrastructure will be **exposed via secure, integrated API services.** This openness **facilitates access for external partners and institutions,** fostering **multi-center collaboration, regional health information exchange, and a shared ecosystem for AI-driven healthcare innovation.**
